This is a so called Native Extension for Adobe AIR 3, which will allow you
to read the output of the proximity sensor on devices which have one. 

Both Android and iOS are supported, as well as a "default" implementation
which will never dispatch any events (necessary to run app in the simulator
on desktop.) 

The "android" and "ios" contain the native libraries for Android (java) and
iOS (C/ObjC) respectively. The "default" folder contains the dummy AS3
implementation, and the "as" folder contains the AS3 library interface.
